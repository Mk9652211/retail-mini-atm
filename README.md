📌 Problem Statement

With the rapid decline in cash usage and the high operational cost of maintaining ATMs, many ATMs are being shut down, especially in semi-urban and rural areas. This creates inconvenience for users who still require cash for daily needs. At the same time, retail stores handle significant cash flow but lack a structured system to utilize it efficiently.

💡 Proposed Solution

The Retail Enabled Cash Withdrawal System (RECWS) enables users to withdraw cash directly from nearby retail stores using UPI-based digital transactions. Instead of visiting an ATM, customers transfer money digitally to a retailer, who then provides cash instantly. The system manages transactions, retailer cash balance, and commissions through a centralized web application integrated with Firebase.
